<h2>FEED THE VAMP</h2>

This is a very simple top-down 2D game built with C, utilising MLX42 library. The program takes a .ber map as argument, and the player has to collect all collectibles on the map before they can exit - but look out for enemies! ðŸ˜ˆðŸ§„

In my game, the player is a vampire on the prowl in a castle garden. The vampire is hungry and needs to eat all the noblemen who are casually hanging out in the garden, before it can go to its coffin and slumber for the day.

I have made all the graphics myself in collage style with Photoshop, using royalty-free images from image banks.

<h3>ðŸ¦‡Mandatory partðŸ¦‡</h3>
  â˜†  <strong>map validation:</strong>  map can only be a .ber file, has to be a rectangle, can only contain characters P, 0, 1, E and C, needs to have a certain amount of E/P/C's etc.<br><br>
  
  â˜† <strong>player movement:</strong> up, down, left & right, can't move through or into walls etc.

  â˜† <strong>graphic management:</strong> window opens and stays open, closes when ``ESC`` is pressed or window cross clicked.
<h3>ðŸ¦‡Bonus partðŸ¦‡</h3>
  â˜† Add some animation<br><br>
  â˜† Player loses if they touch an enemy
